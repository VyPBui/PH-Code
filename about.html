                <p>Hello! We created this website as we realized that though some of the population are now more aware of mental illnesses, they don't exactly know how to go about treating it. Some people don't even realize that the way they are feeling or how they have been going about their day could be affection by how their mental health. With this website, we hope to raise awareness and beat the stigma around mental health and provide a safe space for those who need it.</p>
